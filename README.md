* [x] cross section input section properties
* [ ] linear elastic static analysis
* [ ] AMV response of truss and frame elements
* [ ] Deflection response at nodes
* [ ] WebAssembly bindings
* [ ] Serde Serializable or Protobuf types

### Stretch Feature Set
* [ ] Loads on elements between nodes
* [ ] 3 point membrane triangular element
* [ ] 6 point membrane triangular element
* [ ] spring supports

* [ ] Electron App build for Native Windows deployment
* [ ] Some cross section input path generators

### Wishlist Feature Set
* [ ] Undo / Redo
* [ ] Concurrent User Modeling Env
* [ ] Concurrent command line test runner
* [ ] Javascript Module support
* [ ] YAML definitions for specific FEA elements
* [ ] Save modeling changes
* [ ] Save analysis data
* [ ] Backwards compatibility with model versions and data versions
* [ ] Option to use old data version (based on previous build, e.g. v1.0.0 app)
* [ ] Transactional database

## üîã Batteries Included

* [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating
  between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
* [`console_error_panic_hook`](https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook)
  for logging panic messages to the developer console.
* [`wee_alloc`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc), an allocator optimized
  for small code size.
